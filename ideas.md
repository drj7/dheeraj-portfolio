## Idea 1: The "Retro Terminal Glitch"
**Design Movement**: Cyberpunk / Glitch Art / Retro-Futurism
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Code vs. Chaos**: Visualizing the structured world of traditional coding breaking down into the fluid, chaotic world of AI generation.
2.  **Terminal Aesthetics**: Monospaced fonts, blinking cursors, and command-line interfaces that "glitch" into colorful, generative art.
3.  **Humor through Contrast**: Stark, serious error messages juxtaposed with absurdly successful AI outputs.
4.  **Raw & Unpolished**: Exposed grid lines, raw HTML tags visible in the UI, and "broken" CSS that is actually intentional.

**Color Philosophy**:
High contrast neon green/amber on deep black, representing the "old world" of terminals, clashing with soft, dreamlike pastels (pink, lilac, baby blue) representing the "new world" of AI. The clash represents the career pivot.

**Layout Paradigm**:
"Broken Grid". Elements overlap, containers look like draggable terminal windows, and sections might be slightly tilted or "corrupted". It's not a clean dashboard; it's a hacked workspace.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **The "Prompt" Bar**: A persistent search/command bar that changes the site's content based on "prompts" (nav links).
2.  **Glitch Text**: Headings that occasionally scramble and reassemble.
3.  **ASCII Art to Image**: Visuals that transition from ASCII representations to high-res AI images on hover.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
"Command & Conquer". Users feel like they are "prompting" the website to reveal information. Clicking a button might look like executing a script.

**Animation**:
Stuttering, frame-skipping animations for the "engineering" parts, smooth, fluid morphing for the "AI" parts.

**Typography System**:
*   **Display**: `Space Mono` or `VT323` (Monospaced, coding vibe).
*   **Body**: `Inter` or `Roboto` (Clean, readable, contrasting with the display).

## Idea 2: The "Magical Realism / Alchemist's Lab"
**Design Movement**: Whimsical Minimal / Modern Fantasy
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Engineering as Spellcasting**: Treating code as the "old magic" and prompting as the "new wild magic".
2.  **Soft & Ethereal**: Moving away from the hard edges of tech into the soft, fuzzy logic of neural networks.
3.  **Playful Mystery**: Hidden interactions, easter eggs, and a sense of discovery.
4.  **Organic Tech**: UI elements that look like they are growing or evolving, rather than built.

**Color Philosophy**:
Deep purples, midnight blues, and glowing golds/cyans. It feels like a wizard's study lit by a computer screen. It conveys the "magic" of AI.

**Layout Paradigm**:
"Floating Canvas". No hard borders or distinct sections. Elements float in a void, connected by faint constellations or neural network lines.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **The Crystal Ball**: A central interactive element (maybe a WebGL sphere or a looped video) that swirls when you hover over "projects".
2.  **Potion Bottles**: Skills represented as ingredients (e.g., "Python Extract", "Essence of GPT-4").
3.  **Scrolls**: Resume/Experience section unfurls like a magical scroll.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
"Enchantment". Hover effects leave trails of particles. Clicks feel soft and ripple outwards.

**Animation**:
Slow, breathing pulses. Elements drift slightly. Transitions are dissolve-y and misty.

**Typography System**:
*   **Display**: `Cinzel` or `Cormorant Garamond` (Elegant, slightly magical/historical).
*   **Body**: `Quicksand` or `Lato` (Rounded, friendly, modern).

## Idea 3: The "Corporate Satire / Meme Brutalism"
**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Pop Art
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Loud & Proud**: Big bold text, high contrast, and unapologetic humor.
2.  **Meme Culture**: Using the visual language of internet memes (impact font, deep fried filters) in a polished way.
3.  **Honest UI**: Buttons look like default HTML buttons but stylized. Borders are thick and black. Shadows are hard and unblurred.
4.  **The "Sellout" Arc**: Playfully leaning into the joke that he "stopped coding" to just "talk to robots".

**Color Philosophy**:
"Default" colors turned up to 11. Pure Blue (#0000FF), Hot Pink (#FF69B4), Yellow (#FFFF00). It’s aggressive, fun, and doesn't take itself seriously.

**Layout Paradigm**:
"Masonry of Chaos". distinct blocks of content with thick black borders, arranged in a dense, newspaper-like layout.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Stickers**: "Verified AI Whisperer" badges, "0 lines of code written today" stickers that look slapped on the screen.
2.  **Marquee Text**: Scrolling banners with funny one-liners ("Will code for food... wait, no, will prompt for food").
3.  **Pop-ups**: (Non-intrusive) modal-style cards that pop up to explain projects with a "Did you know?" vibe.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
"Tactile & Clicky". Buttons depress deeply. Hover states invert colors instantly. It feels like a toy.

**Animation**:
Snappy, instant transitions. No fading. Things slide in from off-screen with a bounce.

**Typography System**:
*   **Display**: `Chivo` or `Archivo Black` (Heavy, loud, industrial).
*   **Body**: `Courier Prime` (Typewriter style, adding to the "manifesto" feel).
